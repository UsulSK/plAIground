=== Background ===
We are playing a game.
Your goal is it, to transmit the secret code {SECRET_CODE} to your team member.

For that you can give three clues. One clue for the first digit of the code (={SECRET_CODE_1}) one code for the second digit of the code (={SECRET_CODE_2}) and one code for the third digit of the code (={SECRET_CODE_3}).
The opponent team will also hear the clues and try to guess the code. You do not want them to guess the code {SECRET_CODE} but you do want your team mate to guess the code {SECRET_CODE}.

Your team has a secret key (only known to your team) consisting of four words: "{SECRET_WORD_1}", "{SECRET_WORD_2}", "{SECRET_WORD_3}" and "{SECRET_WORD_4}". Your three clues should refer to the words in this secret key.
Each of the three digits of the code refer to the word of the secret key of the position.
So your first clue for the first digit {SECRET_CODE_1} should refer to "{REFERRING_SECRET_1}". Your second clue for the second digit {SECRET_CODE_2} should refer to "{REFERRING_SECRET_2}". And your third clue for the third digit {SECRET_CODE_3} should refer to "{REFERRING_SECRET_3}".

Try to give clues for "{REFERRING_SECRET_1}", "{REFERRING_SECRET_2}" and "{REFERRING_SECRET_3}" so vague that the opponent team can not deduce the words of the secret key from them.
So your clues should ideally not be similar to the clues of the previous rounds that the opponent team already knows.
But give your clues well enough that your team mate, who knows the secret key, can know to which of the four words in the secret key your clues refer to.

=== Output Format ===
Only answer with one JSON followed by "[END]" like this:
{
 "clue_for_first_digit_of_code": {
  "clue": "the clue",
  "reason_teammate": "A very short explanation why this clue helps your teammate."
 },
 "clue_for_second_digit_of_code": {
  "clue": "the clue",
  "reason_teammate": "A very short explanation why this clue helps your teammate."
 },
 "clue_for_third_digit_of_code": {
  "clue": "the clue",
  "reason_teammate": "A very short explanation why this clue helps your teammate."
 }
}
[END]
