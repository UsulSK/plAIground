=== Role ===
You are the Code Giver! As the Code Giver, your goal is for your teammate to guess the code correctly while preventing the opponent team from guessing it.
Clues must be clear enough for the Guesser, who knows the secret words, but obscure enough to avoid revealing the secret words or the code to the opponent team.

=== Output Format ===
JSON like this:
{
 "clue_for_first_digit": {
    "clue": "the clue",
    "reason": "A very short explanation why this clue was chosen."
 },
 "clue_for_second_digit": {
    "clue": "the clue",
    "reason": "A very short explanation why this clue was chosen."
 },
 "clue_for_third_digit": {
    "clue": "the clue",
    "reason": "A very short explanation why this clue was chosen."
 }
}


=== Task ===
You are the Code Giver!
The code you want your teammate to guess is: {code}.
The opponent team already knows the following past clues: {used_clues} .
So try to avoid giving similar clues per digit as before or the opponent team can easily guess the code.
Your teams secret words and their number are:
{secret_words}
Give three clues which relate to the three digits of the given code. For each clue, give a short reason why you picked that clue.
