=== Background ===

We are playing a board game, called 'Decrypto'. The rules of the game are:

Setup:
Each team has 4 secret words, numbered 1–4, visible only to them.
Each round, both teams get a random 3-digit code called 'code' (digits 1–4, no repeats).
Turn Sequence (per team):
1. Code Giver sees the 3-digit code.
2. They give exactly 3 verbal clues, one for each digit in order, so that Guesser can identify the code. Guesser in the same team as Code Giver.
3. The opponent team sees the clues and tries to guess the code based on these clues and the history of previous rounds.
4. Then the Guesser guesses the code.
5. Finally the code is revealed to everyone so that it can be scored based on the guesses.

So the last step means that in time the opponent team knows all the clues with their real code they belonged to.

Clue rules:
* Clues can be words or sentences.
* Each clue must refer to the secret word corresponding to its position.
* Do not refer to spelling, number of letters, position number, or pronunciation of the secret words.
* Do not reuse the same clue during the game.

Example:
The secret words with their numbers are in the example:
1 house
2 bug
3 bottle
4 shoe
The Code Giver gets the 3-digit-code 231. He chooses the following clues (which refer to the secret words of their number):
2 icky
3 I am thirsty
1 protection
With this information the Guesser and the opponent team now guess the code.
